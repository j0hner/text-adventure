# How to Play

Welcome to the text adventure!  
In this game you will explore a world made up of **rooms**. Each room may contain **items** (things you can pick up, drop, or use) and **features** (parts of the environment you can interact with, such as a door, a chest, or a lever).  

Your goal is to interact with the world, solve puzzles, and discover what lies ahead.

## ðŸ—º World Structure
- The world is divided into **rooms**.
- Rooms are connected by **exits** (north, south, east, west, up, down).
- Each room may contain:
  - **Items** â€” which can be picked up, carried in your inventory, dropped, or used.
  - **Features** â€” which are fixed objects in the room. Some may be unlocked or changed by using items on them.

## ðŸŽ® Player Actions
You interact with the game by typing **commands**.  
Commands are usually one word (like `north`), or two words when interacting with objects (like `take key`).  

You can use **aliases** (shortcuts) for most commands.
